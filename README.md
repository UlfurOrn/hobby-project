A hobby project to try out some stuff

## Setup

### Pants

This project uses the [pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) project.
Pants is a build system for creating monorepos.
It's an interesting tool which I've wanted to try out.

To install pants you can follow the instructions found [here](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/getting-started/installing-pants);
or by following the instructions below:
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://static.pantsbuild.org/setup/get-pants.sh | bash

# Or if you prefer homebrew on MacOS
brew install pantsbuild/tap/pants
```
